      ### Purpose

      Gamebox was designed to spring board game development. It allows the developer to define business rules about a game very quickly without having to worry about resource loading, sound/music management, creating windows, or messing with viewports. Gamebox allows you to define a game's business rules within minutes, using the metaphor of a 5th grade play.

      [GRAPHIC: illustration of kids in costumes on a stage]

      The driving idea behind Gamebox is to provide the ability to have as many of the basic common pieces of a 2D game at the developers disposal from the beginning.

      ### Overview

      #### Installation

      * `gem install gamebox`
      * `git clone git://github.com/shawn42/gamebox.git && cd gamebox && bundle && rake install`

      #### Game Creation

      To create a new Gamebox project run:

          $ gamebox zapper

      To run your game:

          $ cd zapper
          $ bundle
          $ rake


  #stages.tab-pane
    :markdown
      ### Stages

      - what are they
          - The place where actors interact and perform
          - different gameplay types / modes

      What is a stage?

      - Creates actors
      - Defines a gameplay mode
        - Multiple "maps" or "levels" might be the same stage.

        [GRAPHIC: Screenshots of a main menu, a few gameplay levels, and a credits screen. Screenshots grouped into sections for what stage they are (main_menu, gameplay, credits)]

      - Examples:
        - Main menu
        - Overworld
        - Dungeon
        - Credits

      #### Defining a stage

      - curtain\_up / curtain\_down
      - pausing
      - backstage

      ### Actors

      #### What they are

      [GRAPHIC: An actor contains multiple attributes and multiple behaviors]

      Actors can be things that you see on the screen:

      - The player space ship
      - An alien
      - A bullet
      - The background
      - The score on the screen

      [GRAPHIC: Screenshot with different actors circled and labelled]

      Actors can also be hidden things that interact with other actors.

      An actor is made up of two kinds of things: behaviors, and observable attributes.

      ##### Behaviors
      - What are behaviors?

      ##### Observable Attributes
      - What are observable attributes?

      #### Defining an actor type

      #### Adding actors to the stage

      To get an actor on the stage, use the `create_actor` method on stage. This can be done directly from a stage or from a behavior that has required stage via `requires :stage`.


  #actorviews.tab-pane
    :markdown
      ### Actor Views

      - rendering overview
      - layers & parallax
      - defining actor views
      - setting view on an actor (non magic name)
      - custom renderer (here, stages, or advanced)

      Actor views are the mechanism for drawing an actor in Gamebox. When an actor is created, Gamebox will see if there is a matching actor view by name. It will register the view to be drawn by the renderer. The draw callback is called with the rendering target, the x and y offsets based on the viewport, and the z layer to be used for drawing this actor (see the section on parallax layers for more on z layers).

          define_actor_view :label_view do
            draw do |target, x_off, y_off, z|
              target.print actor.text, actor.x, actor.y, z, actor.font_style
            end
          end


  #behaviors.tab-pane
    :markdown
      ### Behaviors

      - what are they
      - how to define them
      - how to inject dependencies with `requires`

      Behaviors are what bring life to actors.  They interact interact with the actor's internal data, input, audio, etc.

      Examples:


  #input.tab-pane
    :markdown
      ### Input & Updates

      - input manager
      - director for updates

      Input comes from the InputManager. The stage has direct access via the `input_manager` method. Behaviors can request that they get the `input_manager` via `requires :input_manager`. The preferred way of getting input to your actors is via the actor's `input` method. It returns an InputMapper that can be built with a hash of events. Behaviors then subscribe for those events from the actor's input, or ask for it during updates.

          actor.input.map_input '+space' => :shoot,
                                '+w' => :jump,
                                '+a' => :walk_left
                                '+s' => :duck
                                '+d' => :walk_right

          actor.input.when :shoot do
            # shoot code
          end

          # or
          if actor.input.walk_left?
            # walk left
          end


  #audio.tab-pane
    :markdown
      ### Sound &amp; Music

      SoundManager handles the autoloading of sounds from `data/sounds` and `data/music`. The stage has direct access via `sound_manager`. To allow an actor to emit sounds or music, give them the `audible` behavior.  See Reactions below for usage from actors.

          # music
          sound_manager.play_music :overworld

          # sounds
          sound_manager.play_sound :death
